The default value is 0.01%, which means it will place buy orders at a price 0.01% higher than the average price and sell orders at a price 0.01% lower than the average price. Most tokens can be traded faster this way. If the price offset is set to 0, buy and sell orders will be placed at the average price simultaneously, with the smallest spread, but there is a risk of non-execution. It is recommended to place orders with a price offset of 0.01% or 0.005% when the price is stable.",
